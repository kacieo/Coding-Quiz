Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

JS needs:
- event listner for start button on click w document.queryselector + timer for 75 seconds, decreasing
- present question, answer question sequence (template literals)
    validation below answer </br> "Correct!" "Incorrect"
- if answer wrong, then decrease time on clock by "x" amount of seconds
- when sequence/loop finished || timer = "0", = game over
- game over = alert(Enter your initials) + getScore append element
- view high scores 

functions:
    - build quiz
    - show score

        //  quotes
        // paraentheses

    //answer: console log


    show score flow:
        when end game, 
        "All finished!"
        Your score is: score
        Enter your initials in text field + submit buttoon
            View High Scores:
